Who are you people and what am I doing here?
</h1>

<p>
Excellent question!
<br>
<br>
You have found your way to SynTechnologies.
<br>
<br>
We are <b>the leading think tank</b> for privacy invading home cooking applications for all major smartphones!
<br>
<br>
Don't know what's in your fridge?
<br>
<br>
Well, with our app, you will soon know all the dirty inner most secrets of your kitchen and its content.
<br>
<br>
And so will way, thanks to our revolutionary new technology that identifies, itemizes, and displays all potential meals<br>
you could cook, while simultaneously uploading it to our totally legit servers that will most probably not be sold off <br>
to your local super market so they can tailor their upcoming <strike>letterbomb</strike> advertising campaign to your <br>
unique and individual needs.
<br>
<br>
But it gets better from there!
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Custom recipes will abound for all cooking styles!
</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Ever wanted to cook your cat?
</strong>
<br>
<br>
Oh? no? me neither...
<br>
That thread on reddit is pure lies made to ruin my reputation! It was a hypothetical question... seriously.
<br>
<br>
Anyway. My point is, that this app will give you access to thousands of recipes from all countries and cultures.<br>
All in the palm of you hand! <sup> For $79.99 per month with 6 years payment required in advance</sup>
<br>
<br>
So, what are you waiting for?
