Project Idea: Chef Mate! App

Overview

"What's for dinner?"

Our lives have become easier from the advancement of technology. We now have the ability to access information at our fingertips, make tasks easier and complete them in a shorter timeframe. For our IT project, we would like to design a recipe app for those that are interested to cook at home that you can download onto any smartphone or tablet. Like any recipe app out there, users will have access to thousands of recipes and have the option to narrow down their search by applying filters. But what makes our app different and special is the user can take a photo of the contents in their fridge, freezer and pantry, then select their preferences, and the app will identify what ingredients they have on hand and match the user with recipes available, thus creating value.

Motivation

For those interested in cooking at home, how many of us go do our weekly groceries but end up wasting the ingredients and have to throw them out? We have the best intentions but life gets in the way and we end up eating out, getting takeaway, grabbing fast food or ordering Uber Eats. In addition, all the other recipe apps do not take into account what ingredients you do or donâ€™t have at home without you listing each ingredient individually. We believe this app and the enhanced features will provide a solution for those who are hobbyist or those who are conscious of their finances, environment and health by making cooking simpler which also helps them save money and decrease food wastage.

Description

The app will be visually stunning, elegant and extremely user friendly. The colour scheme will be bold and bright as people generally associate bright colours with appetite and it triggers a happy emotion. It will contain thousands of photos of mouth watering pictures of food and short video guides rather than lengthy text descriptions.

The feature that will make the app stand out from the rest will be the feature that allows users to take a photo of the contents in their fridge, freezer and pantry and the app will then identify what ingredients the user has on hand based on the pictures. The user will then be prompted to apply filters such as meal type, for example, meat type, vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, keto, dairy free, egg free etc. The user will then be required to select a time frame, for example under 30 minutes, and portion size. Based on the users preferences and ingredients available, the app will then list recipes available. This also includes recipes where the ingredients were able to be substituted with what you currently have and original ingredients plus alternatives listed for next time for those that are curious.

As expected, users will also have access to a database containing recipes created by nutritionists, professional chefs and other users. Users can search recipes they like and view other recipes that share the same or similar ingredients. Alternatively, users can search via ingredients to view recipes available. Anywhere where an ingredient can be subsituted for something else will also be listed. There will be a personal cookbook feature where users can bookmark and favourite the recipes they like and further customise the recipes by adding or removing ingredients and steps. All recipes will include nutritional information.

There will also be a meal planning feature where users can look up recipes or ingredients, select the desired portions and the app will create a shopping list on their behalf. This has the potential to significantly reduce costs and food wastage as users will be buying ingredients in bulk. The app can also be linked to google home where users can add or change items to their shopping list with ease.

Concerned about losing weight but don't know where to start? Generally, weight loss is generally 75% diet and 25% exercise. With access to diet plans, you can shape up fast by eating smarter. Users will also be able to visualise their progress by tracking their eating and drinking habits via a food diary. 

In built kitchen tools to assist with meal preparation will be included. Such tools include measurements, weight, unit conversions and timer. While cooking, you will be able to cross of ingredients and steps as you go.

To generate steady revenue, the app will be subscription based offering two subscription tiers. Subscribers will have access to discounts as the app will be partnered with the big supermarkets. All subscribers will have access to discounts but those on the higher tier will have access to further special discounts and free once per week home delivery. Additionally, users will have the abilitiy to set up auto reordering - never run out of items again!

Finally, there will be a social aspect where you can share your cooking experience with other users. You can share your own recipes, share existing recipes, your photos, your shopping lists and see what your friends are making. Sharing your shopping lists can help other families of the same size regarding their budget. Users can comment, rate and vote on recipes or meal photos. Once a month, user with the highest vote for recipe or picture will receive credit towards their shopping list.

As you can see, the app will incorporate all the necessary features currently on the market but has gone through innovation to include additional features to make it unique and exceed expectations. We want this app to be THE go to recipe app for every cook, no matter what your skill level is.

Tools & Technologies

The app will need to be compatible with Android and Apple phones and tablets. To design the app, we will first come out with a design on pen and paper to visualise what the interface will look like before using a wireframe tool for the skeletal framework and map out the flow. Once the design and functionalities have been mapped out, we will need to choose a programming language to code the app and a mobile app building platform to create it. The app will obviously be refined through continuous testing and feedback before being release live to the public.

Skills Required

A strong knowledge of multiple programming languages is definitely required, especially of swift and java considering they are the official languages of Apple and Android respectively. Additionally, quality user interface design skills focusing on user experience and cross platform knowledge will be extremely beneficial. Backend computing knowledge will also be required regarding security, memory allocation, database management and hardware integration. Finally, other skills and knowledge relating to designing, content writing, Q&A and testing, marketing and agile methodologies are applicable. As such, communication skills are important as well. Fortunately, these skills are obtainable if my team is built with the right people.

Outcome

The main selling point is the app allows users to quickly take a photo of what they have in the kitchen and the app retrieves all the recipes available with the ingredients on hand. If this project becomes successful, it will become the go to app for recipes and food community as the app includes everything you need and more all in one centralised location. This project will hopefully assist households to save time, money and decrease food wastage. It may even ignite a foodie passion among some of us. By spreading knowledge of affordable cooking at home, hopefully this encourages people to be healthier because they are more aware of their food, body and time
