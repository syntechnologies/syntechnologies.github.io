# Interview

## A bit about
Joel Smith - Graduated with distinction from RMIT University with a bachelors degree in Information Technology, 
majoring in Application Programming.

### What kind of work is done by the IT professional?

- Job description is that of a Software Engineer - but my team owns & operates all of our own infrastructure so my daily work also 
involves DevOps/Systems Admin work.

### What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?

Daily work involves interacting with:
 - Other developers on my team, and 
 - Data scientists & Data engineers that are part of my project
 - Iteration manager for my team
 - The 'business' side of my project - Business Development (sales), Product Owner, Finance, etc.  I work on a very self-contained project so we have all of these people in the same room as us.

Less frequently:
 - Other technical teams in the organisation when we need some work done for us

Thankfully I don't have to deal with the general public.

### Where does the IT professional spend most of their time? 

At my desk in front of a computer.

### What aspect of their position is most challenging?

This is actually a hard one to answer. I guess I've been very lucky in that the hardest aspect of my job has always actually 
been the work itself.  I'd probably say it is that we are always trying new technologies to see if we will benefit from their use - 
trying to do a properly impartial evaluation of a new tool and presenting findings to your peers is something I don't have much 
love for doing.
