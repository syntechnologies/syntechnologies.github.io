# My Group Reflection 

## What went well?
Our group is very active, we communicate well and our discussions are mostly on topic and assignment related. Each team member worked to their own relevant strengths and submitted required data on time/as requested. 

## What could be improved?
A better checklist to show what and where we are up to too keep track of assignment progress. More full group catchups to all sit down and discuss where we are at and what needs to get done. 

## At least one thing that was surprising:
How awesome my group is. Everyone is super friendly and very switched on. We all contribute to discussions and get things done quickly. 

## At least one thing you have learned about groups:
Timezones are a pain when it comes to getting everyone available at the same time. Its sometime hard to get involved with some chats when stuck at work. Having a full group of active team members makes tasks a lot easier and if we had inactive members it would put a lot more stain on the others. Also having group members all aiming to get above average marks motivates others to be active and proactive.
