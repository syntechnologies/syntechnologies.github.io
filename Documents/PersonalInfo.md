My name is Jae Sung Oh (s3807452) and came here from Korea when I was about 2. 
I love to play computer games from many different genres - mainly RTS, FPS, and MMORPG.
I also enjoy playing football (soccer) and of course, like many millenials, binge on Netflix. 
I have absolutely no experience in IT, but very keen to learn about it all. 
I’m particularly interested in AI and perhaps game development. 

My name is Luke Green (s3805948) i am married, have a 2-year-old daughter named Evie and live in Perth. 
In my spare time that I’m not spending with my wife and daughter I play video games mainly on PC (MoBA, FPS, RPG and BR).
My interests in IT are broad but I have always had a curiosity in Autonomous Mining and Programming. 
My IT experience consists of 5 years in IS support and building custom PCs on the side.

Ny Name is Natalie Yelland-Hall (S3804985). I am 25 years old currently studying IT at RMIT university. I love reading and video games and
relaxing with all my pets. I live in country Victoria on a farm with my boyfriend and his family. I grew up in north Melbourne with my 
family. I have always been interested and enjoyed IT as it is a subject that has always fasinated me, I have many memories of putting 
together PC's out of spare and hand me down parts and playing games with friends. I would love to find a career in cyber security or
programming someday.
