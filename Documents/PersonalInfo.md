My name is Jae Sung Oh (s3807452) and came here from Korea when I was about 2. 
I love to play computer games from many different genres - mainly RTS, FPS, and MMORPG.
I also enjoy playing football (soccer) and of course, like many millenials, binge on Netflix. 
I have absolutely no experience in IT, but very keen to learn about it all. 
I’m particularly interested in AI and perhaps game development. 

My name is Luke Green (s3805948) i am married, have a 2-year-old daughter named Evie and live in Perth. 
In my spare time that I’m not spending with my wife and daughter I play video games mainly on PC (MoBA, FPS, RPG and BR).
My interests in IT are broad but I have always had a curiosity in Autonomous Mining and Programming. 
My IT experience consists of 5 years in IS support and building custom PCs on the side.

Ny Name is Natalie Yelland-Hall (S3804985). I am 25 years old currently studying IT at RMIT university. I love reading and video games and
relaxing with all my pets. I live in country Victoria on a farm with my boyfriend and his family. I grew up in north Melbourne with my 
family. I have always been interested and enjoyed IT as it is a subject that has always fasinated me, I have many memories of putting 
together PC's out of spare and hand me down parts and playing games with friends. I would love to find a career in cyber security or
programming someday.

Hello, my name is Phuong Quach (s3807136) and I currently live in Melbourne with my three pugs, three cats and fish. I was born and raised in Australia but my family is from China and Vietnam. My hobbies involve gaming, makeup and travelling, and my passion includes animal rescue (it is the main reason why I have so many pets as I'm considered a "foster fail"). I currently work in the finance department of a professional services firm within the legal and financial services and industry. My interest in IT developed through my love of video games as it was my escape from reality and a platform to hang out and catch up with my friends. The areas of IT that interest me the most is VR, AR, robotics and AI, and hopefully one day I will work in one of these fields. I do not have any professional experience in IT apart from being your average daily user so I am excited to see where this journey takes me.
