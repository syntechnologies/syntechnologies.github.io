My name is Michael Seach (s3805363). I am 28 years old, and I live in Sydney NSW
with my wife Mao. I work in a bike shop, filling a sales and mechanical role all
in one, as well as looking after much of the online store fronts. I have always loved
I.T, ever since highschool. I have not had the chance to work in this field, although
I have taught myself various subjects over the years. I have done 3D modelling and 
animation, audio recording and editing, web design as well as build custom systems as
a hobby. I am studying at RMIT to give myself more options in the future in terms of 
career and locations moves, as myself and my wife, would like to move (back) to Japan
in the future.

<p class="aboutUs" style="width:50%">
Hello, my name is Phuong Quach (s3807136) and I currently live in Melbourne with my three pugs, three cats and fish.
I was born and raised in Australia but my family is from China and Vietnam.
My hobbies involve gaming, makeup and travelling, and my passion includes animal rescue (it is the main reason why I have so many pets as I'm considered a "foster fail").
I currently work in the finance department of a professional services firm within the legal and financial services and industry. 
My interest in IT developed through my love of video games as it was my escape from reality and a platform to hang out and catch up with my friends. 
The areas of IT that interest me the most is VR, AR, robotics and AI, and hopefully one day I will work in one of these fields. 
I do not have any professional experience in IT apart from being your average daily user so I am excited to see where this journey takes me.
